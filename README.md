# ElectronTTS

A super simple text-to-speech app I made with Electron and Say.js. Just type some text and hear it out loud.

## What it does
- Type or paste text and click "Speak"
- Nice simple interface with Electron
- Uses Say.js for text-to-speech
- Styled with TailwindCSS
- Works totally offline

## Stuff you need
- Node.js (v20+ should be fine)
- npm (v9+ recommended)
- Git

## How to get it running
```bash
# Grab the repo
git clone https://github.com/RuneSmedhaugen/ElectronTTS.git
cd ElectronTTS

# Install everything
npm install

# How to start the app
npm start
